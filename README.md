# BikeSharing
We analyze NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August 2019 with the help of Tableau.

## Overview
To see the interactive Tableau story, please see here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trevor.crane/viz/CitiBiki_Data_for_NYC/NYCStory?publish=yes)<br>
After going to a trip to New York City, our client noticed something. Citibike was used quite a bit for both tourists and locals to traverse the busy streets. After some pondering, they wanted to see if they could do something similar with their hometown, Des Moines, Iowa. In order to persuade potential investors, it is our job to see if this concept could work in other locales. We will be using Citi Bike data from  August 2019, as that is peak bike riding season.

## Results
In order to see how this would work elsewhere, we want to see if we can see any sort of trends. So, this is what the user base for Citi Bike during the month of August looks like: <br>

From this data, we can observe some key data points. During the month of August, Citi Bike was used a total of 2,344,224 times. Over three quarters of users were subscribers to Citi Bike. This means they ride the bikes on a regular basis, and would provide a good source of income.  We can also see the vast majority of users were males, so this is the demographic to perhaps try to promote to in a new city.  Finally, using the lower graph, we see users are least likely to be using this during two to four in the morning, which would make this the ideal time to make maintainance needed. Meanwhile, during the hours between four and six in the evening are the most used times, when locals and some tourists are heading back home or to their lodging respectively.<br>

Using these two maps, we can see where Citi Bike users would both start and end their trip. The heavily used locations are located in high tourest and large commute traffic. The lesser used locations would be the local residential area. Using this, we should try to focus our stations where the most foot traffic will be had, and where both tourists and locals would be using them. <br>

This graph shows how long each bike is checked out for all riders. Generally, users use their bikes for an hour max, as it heavily tapers out after that. <br>
![Checkout_Times_By_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/191637362-41691a7c-6e86-4b0c-9634-6e81516e5d3c.png) <br>
This graph goes into slightly more detail than the previous one. We try to see if a specific gender rides for longer than others. However, each type tapers off before the hour mark again. This lets us know no matter the gender, users are generally done within an hour. <br>
![Trips_By_Weekday](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/191637616-0e538f12-8f3c-4d43-801b-7ee2a2f15230.png) <br>
This graph shows us how often each bike is used for each weekday of each hour. We can gather Monday through Friday is the busiest time for users, which we could equate to locals going to and from work, as the 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm are the busiest time of days. During the weekends the middle of the days can be seen as the busiest compared to the morning and evening. <br>
![Trips_By_Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107770394/191638014-7907bafc-99ac-4a18-9626-192516378381.png) <br>
Once again, we go deeper into our exploration to se if gender has any impact of thravel times for each weekday of each hour. However, our results are mainly the same as before, where Monday through Friday, 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm are the busiest time of days. <br>

Finally, we take into account the usertype, gender, and day of the week to see any trends. As we noticed by the pie charts from our first slide, Subscribers and males are the largest part of our demographic we should focus on for optimal profit. The middle of the week seems to be the busiest for both subscribers and customers, with a slight dip in Wednesday for each party.

## Summary
In conclusion, there can definitely be profit to be made for Citi Bike outside of NWC, even in Des Moines. The largest profit can be made with many subscribers, as they can continuously use this program. This would appeal to the locals as well, as sometimes traffic can be daunting. Although plenty of females use this program, we should try to promote to a male users, as they are definitely the majority of users. Overall, this could be very profitable to high tourist locations and busy commutes to work.
<br>
Two possible additional inquieries to research how successful this can be include the following:
* Use the same graphs, but during a winter month such as January or February. This will see if this can be profitable year round, not just during the warm summer months.
* See how often certain age groups user Citi Bike. If we can see how often each age group uses Citi Bike, we can see which demographic is the largest, and try to focus drawing them in.
